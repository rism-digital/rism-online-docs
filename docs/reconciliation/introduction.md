# RISM Online Reconciliation API

The RISM Online Reconciliation API is suitable for use with [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org). With this
service you can align your own data with data from RISM, allowing for easier linking and inter-connection between
datasets.

You can read more about how OpenRefine does reconciliation in the [OpenRefine documentation](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/reconciling).

This service is still a work in progress. If you find problems, please let us know by [opening
an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rism-digital/rism-online-issues/issues/).
